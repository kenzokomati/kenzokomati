# ðŸ¤—Hey, glad you're here!
I possess a robust foundation in technology and programming, honed through hands-on projects and diverse experiences. As a scholar in the Future Generation Training Program of the Nikkei Community, I had the opportunity to spend a month in Japan on an educational and socio-cultural exchange. This experience equipped me with exceptional adaptation and communication skills in multicultural settings. Additionally, my involvement in a voluntary research project focused on classifying arrhythmias and cardiac ischemias from electrocardiograms further developed my analytical and technical expertise.
Here you'll find projects I participated in or developed as a side project.
